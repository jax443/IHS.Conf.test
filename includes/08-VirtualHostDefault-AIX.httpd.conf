# Default Server 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

# Choose user for the HTTP Server to run as
#
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.  
#
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
# Either use nobody or create a new User and Group that have no rights 
# read access to the DocumentRoot directory.
#
# A new user is the prefered configuration.
#
User nobody
Group nobody

# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
#
#ServerAdmin you@your.address

# Enable HTTP on port 80
# Listen: Allows you to bind the web server to specific IP addresses 
# and/or ports, in addition to the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Listen directives must be qualified with either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
# Use 0.0.0.0 for the default IPv4 address and [::] for the default IPv6
# address.
#
# Format examples:
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 80

# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, server-generated
# redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make 
# redirections work in a sensible way.
#
# ServerName format options, IP should always work.
#ServerName HOSTNAME.DEPARTMENT.CA.GOV:80
#ServerName HOSTNAME.DEPARTMENT.CA.GOV
ServerName 134.187.147.69

# UseCanonicalName: Determines how Apache constructs self-referencing 
# URLs and the SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT variables.
# When set "Off", Apache will use the Hostname and Port supplied
# by the client.  When set "On", Apache will use the value of the
# ServerName directive.
#
# Leave off so that the VIP (load banalancer) name is used. 
UseCanonicalName Off

# This directive overrides the behavior of TRACE for both the core server
# and mod_proxy. The default TraceEnable on permits TRACE requests per 
# RFC 2616, which disallows any request body to accompany the request. 
# TraceEnable off causes the core server and mod_proxy to return a 
# 405 (Method not allowed) error to the client.
#
TraceEnable off

# AddServerHeader
# This directive provides a means to enable or disable ServerHeader values.
# The default value is "On". This provides a server header according to the
# values specified in the ServerTokens and ServerSignature directives.
# Setting this directive to "Off" results in no server header information
# being returned to clients.
# Set to one of: On | Off
#
#AddServerHeader Off

# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The built-in default is 'Full' which sends information about 
# the OS-type and compiled in modules.  The recommended value is 'Prod' 
# which sends the least information.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minor | Minimal | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
#
#
# This is set to Prod due to security requirements. Hides server details
ServerTokens Prod

# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory 
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated 
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
#
# This is set to off due to security requirements.  Hides IHS server details on pages
ServerSignature off

# AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers (Mosaic/X 2.1+) uncompress
# information on the fly. Note: Not all browsers support this.
# Despite the name similarity, the following Add* directives have nothing
# to do with the FancyIndexing customization directives above.
#
AddEncoding x-compress Z
AddEncoding x-gzip gz tgz
